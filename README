Wrapper class for libanvil to be able to request specific ranges from a minecraft world. This is just the embryo for it and is a work in progress.

I built this using MINGW64 (Msys2).

Instructions:

1. git clone https://github.com/majestic53/libanvil.git 
2. git clone https://github.com/o40/libAnvilWrapper.git
3. cd libanvil
4. make
5. cd ../libAnvilWrapper
6. make
